"""
find_knuckle_tattoos.py

This code reads an input file which is a newline separated list of words.
It then finds all words of length N and 2*N (generally, N=4).
It then rearranges the words of length N, and sees if the new words are found in the list of words of length N and N*2.
The rearrangement is similar to if you had two words tattooed on your knuckles, and then intertwined your fingers.
e.g. ABCD and 1234 would becomes A1C3 and B2D4. Of course, these are not valid words.
It prints, in tsv format (tab-csv), the initial words, the final words, and the word type (2 words of length N, or 1 word of length 2*N)
